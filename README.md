# Password Generator

## Created a Randomized Password Generator

The user selected how long they wanted their passcode to be and if they wanted to use special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers.

Then the program would randomly select: special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers (depending on which options the user selected) in the length the user input.
